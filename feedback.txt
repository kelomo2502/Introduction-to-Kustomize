Working on the Introduction to Kustomize project gave me a solid understanding of how Kustomize simplifies Kubernetes configuration management. I learned how to structure base and overlay directories, apply patches, manage environments (like dev and prod), and reduce duplication in Kubernetes manifests. It also helped me appreciate the power of declarative configuration and how Kustomize fits into GitOps and CI/CD workflows. Overall, it was a practical and eye-opening experience in managing scalable Kubernetes deployments more efficiently.
